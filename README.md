# **KTP Data Extractor**

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **KTP Data Extractor** is an advanced machine learning-powered application that extracts critical information from **Indonesian KTP (Kartu Tanda Penduduk)** images. Using object detection, segmentation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, the application efficiently detects the KTP area, crops it, and reads the text fields.

By utilizing **YOLO for object detection**, **Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)**, and **Donut🍩 OCR models**, this app provides a complete solution for extracting and processing structured KTP data with high accuracy.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic KTP Detection**: Detects KTP area from an image, even when it’s not perfectly aligned.
- **Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) Detection**: Accurately determines the orientation and corners of the KTP in the image.
- **OCR with Donut🍩 Model**: Extracts text information (name, ID number, birthdate, etc.) from the KTP image.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly web interface for uploading KTP images and viewing extracted data in real-time.
- **GPU Support**: Supports GPU acceleration for fast inference on large datasets.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: For oriented bounding box object detection and segmentation of the KTP area.
- **Donut🍩 (VisionEncoderDecoderModel)**: A state-of-the-art OCR model for extracting text data from images.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and transformation.
- **Streamlit**: To build the interactive web-based user interface.
- **PyTorch**: For running and handling deep learning models.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Pip package manager
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KTP-Data-Extractor.git
cd KTP-Data-Extractor
```

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install PyTorch (GPU support, optional)

If you have a GPU and want to speed up inference, install PyTorch with CUDA support:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Download Pre-trained Models

The application requires several pre-trained models. Download or place the following models in the project directory:

1. **YOLO Segmentation Model** (`segment_model.pt`)
2. **YOLO OBB Model** (`obb_model.pt`)
3. **Donut🍩 Processor and OCR Model** (`donut_ktp_processor` and `donut_ktp_model`)

Place these models in the correct paths as indicated in the `app.py` file or the `models.py` module.

## 🚀 Running the Application

Once everything is set up, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

### Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Upload an image containing a KTP.
2. **Retrieve Data**: Click on the `Retrieve` button to extract and display data from the KTP.
3. **View Results**: The KTP image will be processed, displayed, and extracted information will be shown below the image.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **KTP Detection**:
   - The uploaded image is processed by a **YOLOv8 segmentation model** that detects the KTP card within the image.
   - An **Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)** is calculated to determine the correct perspective.

### 2. **Perspective Transformation**:
   - Using OpenCV, the detected KTP card is wrapped and aligned into a fixed-size rectangular image for easier text extraction.

### 3. **OCR Processing**:
   - The aligned KTP image is passed to the **Donut VisionEncoderDecoderModel**, which extracts key text fields such as the NIK, Gender, and Religion.
   
### 4. **Display Results**:
   - The processed KTP image and its extracted text data are displayed in a user-friendly format on the Streamlit interface.
